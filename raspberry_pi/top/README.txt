# Summary

Designed a minimal case for the Raspberry Pi 3 A+ to match my [Pi0W Case](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2177542). It has openings for Power, HDMI, Audio, USB, microSD. I have a plain top as well as a top with an opening for the GPIO pins. ~~I will add a top that has openings for the camera and display ports as well.~~ The bottom has an opening to let you pop your Pi out using your finger.

The pins on the underside of the USB port may stick out a little more than my model. You may need to gently bend them inward if you have any issues getting it full seated in the bottom.

**EDIT: Added new tops with holes. In addition to a plain top with no holes, the following options are now available:**
* Camera opening
* Display opening
* GPIO opening
* Camera and Display openings
* Camera and GPIO openings
* Display and GPIO openings
* Camera, Display, and GPIO  openings
